# RGB stream and Mono camera

This repo has the project to show a RGB stream from the mono camera and a depth map
The Python CV project is an application that displays a real-time RGB stream from a monocular camera alongside a depth map. By leveraging the OpenCV library, the project captures frames from the camera, processes them to generate the RGB stream, and utilizes depth estimation algorithms to create a depth map. This combined visual representation enhances scene perception, aiding in object recognition, scene understanding, and depth-based segmentation tasks. With its flexibility and efficiency, the project offers a valuable tool for computer vision development in Python.
